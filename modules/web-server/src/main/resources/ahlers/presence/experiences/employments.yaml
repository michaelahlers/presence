    commentary: |
      Working with a small team of incredible engineers, my experience at LiveSafe gave me countless valuable experiences. Initially, I joined on to help build upon a legacy platform. Over time, I'd help the team embrace best practices and refine internal patterns. Ultimately, we'd strike out to building a new platform with heavy use of [Lagom](/experiences/lagom).

    commentary: |
      My first professional use of [Scala](/experiences/scala) and [Play Framework](/experiences/play-framework) began working with a small team at their Ashburn, Virginia headquarters. Initially, I'd come on board to maintain a product built with Java EE, then—when an intitiative to build a new log management product began—I successfully petitioned the team to use Scala for the new offering, which was instrumental to successful offering.
