After 12 years of writing software with the [Java programming language](/experiences/java), adaopting Scala as my language of choice—first at [Verizon](/experiences/verizon) in 2012 and ongoing since—reinvigorated my passion for programming. It's multiparadigm design and flexibility and are tremendous strengths, and I find myself every day making short work of difficult problems with this language and its ecosystem.
