      From [`akka.io`](https://akka.io):

      > Akka is a toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications for Java and Scala.
    commentary: |
      A more _elaborate_ commentary on [Akka](http://akka.io) which works with [Scala](/resume/scala).

      Akkaâ€˜s pretty good because:

      - It does stuff.
      - And things!
          - Lots of things.
          - Stuff, too.
