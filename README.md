## Development

### Building

#### Client

This project uses [SBT Play Gulp Plugin](https://github.com/mmizutani/sbt-play-gulp) by [mmizutani](https://github.com/mmizutani), but in a slightly unconventional mannerâ€”it maintains build resources in the root directory rather than in `ui/` as the plugin chooses by default. See `src/main/client/README.md` for details.
