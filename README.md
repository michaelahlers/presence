# Presence

Personal web presence for Michael Ahlers, and full-stack Scala sandbox.

## About

Scala is my favorite language, and I believe its ecosystem offers the best tools, libraries, and frameworks for building modern applications, from back to front—the web browser included.

My aim with this project has been to:

1. Learn [Scala.js][scala-js] and [Laminar][laminar].
1. Refresh long-neglected front-end development skills.

The result is a fun showcase of my professional experience (with more in the works).

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to:

- [Nikita Gazarov][github-nikita-gazarov] not only for building [Airstream][github-raquo-airstream] and [Laminar][github-raquo-laminar] but also for personally providing me with support [Gitter][gitter-laminar].
- [Vincent Munier][github-vincent-munier] for demonstrating how to use [Play Framework's JavaScript routing](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/ScalaJavascriptRouting) with [Scala.js applications](https://github.com/vmunier/play-with-scalajs-example-javascript-router/commit/54494bdeea50cde209c81305f405f8bdf0d156d6), made in response to [an issue I filed back in 2017](https://github.com/vmunier/play-scalajs.g8/issues/50).
- [Antoine Doeraene][github-antoine-doeraene] for documenting the [deployment of full-stack Scala applications (Play Framework and Scala.js) to Heroku](https://antoine-doeraene.medium.com/deploying-a-full-stack-scala-application-on-heroku-6d8093a913b3) using [Heroku's SBT plugin][github-heroku-sbt-heroku], which is necessarily more complicated given multiple modules.
- [Felix Dietze][github-felix-dietze] for maintaining [a rich Scala.js façade library for D3.js][github-fdietze-scala-js-d3v4], to which it's been a pleasure to contribute!
