# Presence

Personal web presence for Michael Ahlers, and full-stack Scala sandbox.

## Acknowledgements

Special thanks to:

- [Vincent Munier][github-vmunier] for demonstrating how to use [Play Framework's JavaScript routing](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x/ScalaJavascriptRouting) with [Scala.js applications](https://github.com/vmunier/play-with-scalajs-example-javascript-router/commit/54494bdeea50cde209c81305f405f8bdf0d156d6), made in response to [an issue I filed back in 2017](https://github.com/vmunier/play-scalajs.g8/issues/50).
- [Antoine Doeraene][github-antoine-doeraene] for documenting the [deployment of full-stack Scala applications (Play Framework and Scala.js) to Heroku](https://antoine-doeraene.medium.com/deploying-a-full-stack-scala-application-on-heroku-6d8093a913b3), which is necessarily more complicated given multiple modules.
